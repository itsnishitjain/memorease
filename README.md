Memorease is designed specifically to assist individuals with Alzheimerâ€™s and Dementia by providing an easy way to track their lives. Using Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text features, users can maintain a journal of their life. This journal is easily accessible through the advanced Gemini API, making it simple to find specific entries, by a very natural method of chatting. Moreover, users can store images of special places, offering a way to revisit important memories. Our app also includes location features to help ensure safety, while caretakers can utilise Memorease to improve tracking and treatment for their patients.
